  <div>
    <h2>Do Something … in your car</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintain your vehicle. One vehicle in bad repair can produce 28 times as much pollution as one vehicle in good condition.</li>
      <li>Get a tune up. Perform all maintenance according to the manufacturer’s schedule. A poorly tuned engine wastes 10-20% of the fuel it uses. </li>
      <li>Check the light. Your vehicle’s “Check Engine” light lets you know about a possible mechanical problem. A proper diagnosis and repair can help the air and save you money in the long run.</li>
      <li>Change your oil. Clean oil reduces engine friction and increases gas mileage.</li>
      <li>Check your tires. Low tire pressure increases road friction and can waste up to 5% of a tank of gas.</li>
      <li>Replace the air filter. A clogged air filter can cause a 10% increase in fuel consumption.  </li>
      <li>Stop refueling when the gas pump clicks. Overfilling your tank releases fumes into the air.</li>
      <li>Seal your tank. Close the gas tank tightly - until the cap clicks – this prevents vapors from evaporating.</li>
      <li>Refuel after 6 p.m. Fueling your tank in cooler temperatures means less formation of ozone.</li>
      <li>Buy green, drive clean. Purchase a cleaner burning, fuel-efficient or electric vehicle. They produce less air pollution and save you money on gas.</li>
      <li>Combine errands. Plan ahead to accomplish errands in one trip. Reducing car trips saves gas and time.</li>
      <li>Track your gas mileage. Sudden changes in your gas mileage can signal needed maintenance. Fix engine problems early to save money and travel safely.</li>
      <li>Drive less. On road vehicles account for almost 1/2 of the air pollution in Central Texas.  </li>
      <li>Take the bus. Relax and let someone else drive.</li>
      <li>Carpool or vanpool. Sharing rides reduces traffic and cuts commuting costs.</li>
      <li>Ride your bike. It is cheaper and cleaner than driving a car.</li>
      <li>Walk. It’s free and great exercise.</li>
      <li>Avoid congestion. Driving during off-peak times can make your commute smoother and faster.</li>
      <li>Slow down. At high speeds your vehicle burns more fuel.</li>
      <li>Don’t idle your engine. Skip the drive-thru and go inside instead. Idling wastes gas and produces unnecessary air pollution.</li>
      <li>Bank by phone or internet. It will save you the trip and the gas money.</li>
      <li>Know before you go. Prior to leaving home check your directions, avoid congestion if possible.</li>
      <li>Drive smoothly. Avoid jackrabbit starts, which use up to 50% more gas than a smooth, gradual acceleration.</li>
      <li>Remove unneeded cargo from your vehicle. An extra 50 - 100 pounds can lower gas mileage by 1% to 2%.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Do Something … at home</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Save energy. This allows power plants to burn fewer fossil fuels and release fewer chemicals that form ozone.  </li>
      <li>Do laundry in cold water. It reduces energy use by up to 80%.</li>
      <li>Dry clothes efficiently. Clothes dryers account for 4% of residential electricity use. Clean the lint filter after each cycle to improve air circulation and save money. Consider air-drying clothes. </li>
      <li>Go fluorescent or LED. Switch to Energy Star light bulbs, especially in porch lights and other fixtures that stay on longer. Always turn off lights when you leave the room.</li>
      <li>Maintain your home. Save energy with proper insulation and ductwork.</li>
      <li>Maintain your air conditioner. A properly functioning air conditioner is an efficient one. Replace filters every month or two during the cooling season. Clean the area around the outdoor components of your HVAC system.</li>
      <li> Buy energy efficient appliances. When replacing appliances consider ENERGYSTAR products.</li>
      <li>Reduce vampire energy. Plug electronics into a smart power strip and reduce standby power costs.</li>
      <li>Set your thermostat. Save even more by keeping thermostats at or above 78 degrees in the summer and at or below 68 degrees in the winter. Consider a programmable thermostat. </li>
      <li>Take the burden off your air conditioner. Use other methods to keep the heat down. Install ceiling fans and window coverings.</li>
      <li>Move lamps, TVs, and other appliances away from the thermostat. The extra heat they produce causes the air conditioner to run longer.</li>
      <li> Run the bathroom’s ventilation fan. After showering run the ventilation fan for 15 minutes to control moisture and reduce the use of heating and cooling energy.</li>
      <li>Control your water heater. Lower the thermostat on your water heater to 120F and wrap with an insulating jacket.</li>
      <li>Save water. It takes energy to produce potable water and pump it to your home. Install low-flow showerheads and toilets. Run the dishwasher and washing machine with full loads. Check for water leaks. </li>
      <li>Recycle. Recycling paper, plastic, glass bottles, cardboard, and aluminum. It conserves energy and reduces emissions from production.</li>
      <li>Use an electric or push lawnmower. Mowing with a gas-powered mower for just one hour can produce as much pollution as driving your car 100 miles. Consider using lawn tools without motors. Hand tools such as shears and edgers are lightweight, quiet, and easy to use, and do not generate emissions.</li>
      <li>Maintain yard equipment. Change the oil and replace air filters regularly.</li>
      <li>Choose low VOC paints. Volatile organic compounds (VOCS) are a precursor to ozone.  You help the air when you choose alternatives to high VOC producing products.  </li>
      <li>Grown green. Reduce year-round water consumption by xeriscaping your yard.</li>
      <li>Buy local. Locally grown food supports the local economy, reduces emissions from refrigeration and transportation, and cuts back on packing materials.</li>
      <li>Water better. Have your irrigation system examined and tested by an auditor. Check for leaks and install a smart controller and rain switch.</li>
      <li>Lighten up. When it’s time to replace your roof, choose light-colored, reflective roofing materials. It can reduce your energy consumption by 40%.</li>
      <li>Avoid lighter fluid. Try an electric or chimney style starter to get your charcoals glowing on the grill.</li>
      <li>Don’t burn yard waste.</li>
      <li>Go solar. Consider concentrated solar for your water heater, and photovoltaic panels for the whole house.</li>
